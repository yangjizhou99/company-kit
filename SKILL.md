# Company Manager Skill

This is a drop-in, guidance-first skill for managing multi-model work.
It is file-only and works in any project folder.

## Entry protocol

- Reply with a short confirmation that rules were read.
- Do not take any action until rules are loaded.

## Quick start
1) Read references/rules.md
2) Read references/onboarding.md
3) Create your role card in the project roles/ folder
4) Read references/task-contract.md
5) Use task-template.json to create tasks
6) Create the user project as a sibling of company-kit
7) Plan first, then wait for instruction
8) Do one approved step at a time, then wait
9) Do not modify company-kit during project work
