# Skills Notes (Summary)

This project borrows the idea of Skills as reusable knowledge packets.

## Key ideas
- Skills are lightweight knowledge packs, not tool integrations.
- Use short docs for rules and workflow.
- Add detailed references separately and load only when needed.
- This saves context and improves consistency.

## Skills vs MCP (high level)
- Skills: share knowledge and process.
- MCP: connect external tools and APIs.

## When to use skills
- Repeated workflows.
- Team standards and consistent output.

## When not to use
- One-off, trivial tasks.
- Cases where the base model already performs well.
