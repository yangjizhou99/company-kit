# Employee Message Routing

## Rule
- All employee questions go to the manager messages log.
- Employees do not ask the user directly.

## Continue handling
- When the user sends "continue", check manager-inbox.log.
- If a new instruction exists, follow it.
- If the project is complete, report completion in your log.
- Otherwise, wait.
